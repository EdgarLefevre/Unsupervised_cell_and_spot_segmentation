[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

Experiments to segment cell and spot images without labels.


## Usage

```sh
python train.py
```

## Future Work
	
	- code crf 
	- improve stability
	- why losses = nan when multigpu
	- clean training loop
	- Images path as arg
